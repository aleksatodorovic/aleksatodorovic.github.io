For the final tutorial I’m consider a few databases. The first is the Arms Transfer Database which
tracks the international flow of major weapons — artillery, missiles, military aircraft, tanks, and the like. Maintained by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the database contains documented sales since 1950 and is updated annually. SIPRI provides a download tool, which outputs rich-text files, but it’s also possible to download the data as CSV, which was one of concerns that’s now resolved. I think this is an awesome dataset as it goes back pretty far and is quite recently updated. It also contains loads of info on what kinds of arms were bought and sold, from ships to artillery, so the data is quite rich. This type of dataset stands out to me because I love history and conflict studies and this type of information can be used to draw additional insights regarding the Cold War, US versus Soviet power blocs, and terrorist movements. 

In addition, I’m considering the OECD’s data on the largest multinational corporations. The ADIMA database tracks multinational corporations — Walmart, Toyota, Nestle, etc. — and their subsidiaries. It currently includes economic statistics about each of the world’s 100 largest multinationals, the names and locations of 26,000 subsidiaries, and information about nearly 20,000 of their websites. The OECD says plans to expand the number of companies in the future. In 2016, the companies in the dataset “generated nearly  trillion in revenues (almost 20% of global GDP), earned  billion in profits and paid  billion in taxes,” according to the OECD. It’s a pretty significant dataset and I think there’s a great opportunity to create visualizations that illustrate relationships between all of these companies, who controls/owns who, etc. 

So there’s also a Venmo dataset! It has millions of transactions taken from the public API. You don’t even need a key. This grad student made a website about this and picked out a few people he found interesting (drug dealer, couples, corn dealer). Basically he was able to track the financial activity of all of these people and many more. I think this would be an awesome dataset to use as venmo is a part of everyday life for most college students, plus you could do some really interesting research regarding financial activity of all the users.
